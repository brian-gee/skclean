### What is the aftercare process? <a name="what-is-the-aftercare-process"></a>

Proper aftercare is essential for a healthy and well-healed tattoo. German Gamboa recommends the following aftercare steps:

1. Remove the bandage after 2-4 hours, but no longer than 6 hours.
2. Gently wash the tattoo with a mild, fragrance-free soap and warm water. Do not scrub.
3. Pat the tattoo dry with a clean paper towel, then allow it to air dry for 15-20 minutes.
4. Apply a thin layer of aftercare ointment (e.g., Aquaphor, Tattoo Goo) to the tattoo. Repeat this step 3-4 times a day for the first 3-4 days.
5. After 3-4 days, switch to a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotion for the remainder of the healing process (approximately 2-3 weeks).
6. Avoid submerging your tattoo in water (e.g., baths, swimming pools, hot tubs) until it is fully healed.
7. Keep the tattoo out of direct sunlight and avoid tanning beds during the healing process. After healing, always apply sunscreen to your tattoo when exposed to sunlight to prevent fading.

If you have any concerns or questions about the healing process, don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact).
